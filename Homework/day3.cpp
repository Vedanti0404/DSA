/**Print number
Two numbers are given, print their product
Two numbers are given a and b, print a-b
Print 6*3 in output, donâ€™t print 18, just 6*3 should be in the output screen.
If we have only 4 bits, How 3 and -6 will be written in 4 bits.
If we have only 5 bits, How 13 and -16 will be written in 5 bits.
